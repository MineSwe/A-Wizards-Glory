This is a website from my highschool website and unity project "A Wizards Glory".
It includes the webpage describing the game and a download link from itch.io or a WEBGL version.
Here's a link to the webpage: https://mineswe.github.io/A-Wizards-Glory-Website/
Tips to download the website files: The ZIP folder includes all HTML, CSS and JS files so just download the ZIP folder, extract it and open the index.html file.
